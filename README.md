## üöÄ Quick Start
### Usage

Welcome to use [Erda Cloud](https://erda.cloud)

### Installation

Please follow How to install Erda.

* [installation document](https://github.com/erda-project/erda/blob/9c904121313821d2b9f7ba15eeebb9286216c4a5/docs/guides/deploy/How-to-install-the-Erda.md)

### Run Erda-UI project

> This repository contains many Node.JS packages. Each package has its own set of commands, but the most common commands are available from the root `package.json` and can be accessed using the `npm run ...` command. Just follow the four steps below to start.

```bash
# Step1 Initialize the project of erda-ui
  # Run the following command in the root directory of erda-ui
	node setup.js

  # What does this command do?
  # 1.1 Initialize dependencies in shell, core, scheduler and cli
  # 1.2 Initialize ./erda/config.js in shell and core
  # 1.3 Register erda-ui command globally
  # 1.4 Generate .env in the root directory of erda-ui, which includes some environment variables


# Step2 Initialize modules in the directory of fdp and admin (Except for modules in the erda-ui directory)
  # Run the following command in the root directory of fdp and admin
	erda-ui setup <module> <port> 
	e.g., erda-ui setup admin 5001

  # What does this command do?
  # The port number of each module can be viewed in the .env file. After successful running, the .erda/config.js configuration file will be generated in the root directory of each module, and the path of the corresponding module will be automatically written in the .env file


# Step3 Build core package
  # Run the following command in the directory of erda-ui/core
	npm run build-dev

  # What does this command do?
  # The core package file will be generated in the public folder of the root directory, and static files will be read from that directory in development mode


# Step4 Start App
  # Run the following command in the directory of erda-ui
  	erda-ui launch

  # What does this command do?
  # The erda-ui directive contains a launch command. Running the erda-ui launch in the root directory of erda-ui can manage the processes of multiple modules in the same window simultaneously, and it will launch the corresponding services based on the modules registered in the .env file
```
