The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Erda UI. Please spend several minutes reading these guidelines before you create an issue or pull request.

## Open Development

All work on Erda UI happens directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/erda-project/erda-ui). Both core team members and external contributors send pull requests which go through the same review process.

## Branch Organization

If you send a bugfix pull request, please do it against the `master` branch, if it's a feature pull request, please do it against the `feature` branch.

## Bugs

We are using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/erda-project/erda-ui/issues) for bug tracking. The best way to get your bug fixed is by using our [issue template](https://github.com/erda-project/erda-ui/issues?template=bug-template).

Before you report a bug, please make sure you've searched existing issues, and read our [FAQ](https://erda-docs.app.terminus.io/faq.html).
